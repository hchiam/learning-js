# Learning JavaScript

Miscellaneous practice code in JS.

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

<https://random-code-tips.surge.sh>

## How to Run .js Files Using Terminal/CommandLine:

Make sure to include console.log("output text here");

    node filename.js

## Learn about Modern ES6 JS Features

<https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/12/practical-ways-to-write-better-javascript>

Also note the stuff around the default values for function arguments here: <https://devhints.io/es6?ref=devawesome.io>

## Bonus

### Automatically format your code upon save

In VSCode: use the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension, and then in VSCode > Code > Preferences > Settings > search for "Format on save" > turn it on with the checkbox

Now it'll automatically format your code, just like the built-in stuff for [Golang](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-golang).

### Get immediate feedback on code errors and style

To automatically re-run a [.js file](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-js/tree/master/more-like-interview-questions) and the test cases in it whenever you edit that file, copy the .js code into [`index.js`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-eslint-google/blob/master/index.js) in my [ESLint repo](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-eslint-google) and do the setup so you can run this command just once:

```bash
nodemon -x 'npm run lint; node index.js'
```

**_Or_** `nodemon -x 'npm run lint; npm run test; node index.js'`

This works just like [`rerun` for Python](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-python/blob/master/README.md#run-code-linter).

**Alternatively:**

To set up [eslint and jest](https://github.com/hchiam/eslint-and-jest) locally inside this learning-js folder:

```bash
npm install jest --global
npm install # eslint is already listed in package.json for you
npm test # runs scripts test command listed in package.json
```

**_Or_** just run this: [`jest`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-jest).

**_Or_** to run just a-specific.test.js, run this: `jest a-specific.test.js`.

You can also automatically include code style fixes in your commits with [`lint-staged`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-lint-staged) set up with `husky`.

### Get code Maintainability Index (MI score)

The MI combines lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, and the Halstead volume metric (i.e. number of variables, operations, decision paths, and lines of code). After you [`npm install -g plato` or `yarn global add plato`](https://github.com/es-analysis/plato), you can get the MI score of your code:

```bash
plato -r -d report index.js
```

Similar to how I use [`radon`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-python/#maintainability-index-mi-score) for Python code.

### Minify code

Install `minify`:

```bash
npm i minify -g # or: yarn global add minify
minify -v
```

Use `minify`:

```bash
minify minify-this-script.js > minified-script.js
```

### Using [`yarn`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-yarn) instead of `npm`

```bash
yarn # instead of npm install or npm run install
yarn test # instead of npm test
```

Instead of `nodemon -x 'npm run test; node index.js'`, you can do:

```bash
nodemon -x 'yarn test; node index.js'
```

### Chrome dev tools tricks for more productive debugging

<https://blog.bitsrc.io/10-tips-to-improve-productivity-using-chrome-dev-tools-7918fc8203f3>

and tips like this: <https://umaar.com/dev-tips/15-dollar-zero>

`$0` = node selected in Elements panel

`$('some_selector')` = shortform for `document.querySelector('some_selector')`

`$$('some_selector')` = shortform for `document.querySelectorAll('some_selector')`

`copy()` = copies to clipboard any value/object/element inside it.

`inspect($('some_selector')[0]);` jumps to Elements panel (jQuery not required for that `$`). Works in Firefox too.

### Edit any website (temporarily on the client side)

Enter this into the console log in dev tools: `document.designMode='on'`

### Read a file

In the browser:

- https://github.com/hchiam/learning-js/blob/master/read-text-file.js or
- https://github.com/hchiam/learning-js/blob/master/read-json-file.js

In the console terminal CLI:

- https://github.com/hchiam/learning-nodejs/blob/master/README.md#read-a-local-file-via-console-cli

### Get a lot of the functions and jQuery event listeners in a script string:

https://github.com/hchiam/getFunctions

### Support modern browsers and older browsers (like IE11) at the same time

```html
<!-- No need for special server setup or user agent sniffing! -->
<script type="module" src="modern.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="legacy.js"></script>
<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLxNdLK--yI -->
```

### Bookmarklets

Only use them after you read and understand the contents of each bookmarklet!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet

https://github.com/hchiam/learning-js/tree/master/bookmarklets#bookmarklets

### `this` keyword in old-school functions vs the newer arrow functions

`this` in `function()` = caller. Useful if you want `this` to change to whatever calls your one function.

`this` in `() => {}` = owner. Useful if you want `this` to always be the creator of the function. I think _nested_ arrow functions also pass along `this`, which you might like.

### CJS vs MJS/ESM/ES6M vs all the other types of JavaScript modules syntax

- ESM = `import` and `export`. Simplest, async, tree-shakeable, but not universally compatible.
- UMD = works everywhere, is more of a pattern of fallbacks, usually the fallback when ESM fails.
- CJS = `require` and `module.exports`, sync, good for BE, commonly seen for node stuff.
- AMD = `define`, async, good for FE, confusing compared to CJS.

### [Priority queue](https://github.com/datastructures-js/priority-queue) which can be used as a min heap or max heap

```js
// in CJS syntax:
const {
  MinPriorityQueue,
  MaxPriorityQueue,
} = require("@datastructures-js/priority-queue");
```

or

```js
// in ESM syntax:
import {
  MinPriorityQueue,
  MaxPriorityQueue,
  PriorityQueueOptions, // queue options interface
  PriorityQueueItem, // queue item interface
} from "@datastructures-js/priority-queue";
```

API usage example:

```js
const pqAsHeap = new MinPriorityQueue();
pqAsHeap.enqueue(num);
pqAsHeap.dequeue();
pqAsHeap.size();
pqAsHeap.front().element;
```

### add type checking even in JS files, no config necessary (in VSCode):

Just add this comment to the top of your JS file:

```js
// @ts-check
```
